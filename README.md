# ü©∫ Advanced Pneumonia Diagnosis from Chest X-ray Images Using Deep Learning

## üìñ Introduction

Pneumonia is a respiratory infection caused by bacteria or viruses and remains a major health challenge, especially in developing and underdeveloped nations. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and survival. Chest X-ray imaging is the most common technique for diagnosing pneumonia, but manual examination is difficult and prone to error.

In this project, we built a deep learning-based system to automatically classify Chest X-ray images as **Pneumonia** or **Normal**.

## üéØ Problem Statement

To develop a system that can automatically differentiate between Chest X-rays of **Pneumonia-affected** individuals and **Normal** individuals using advanced Deep Learning models.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Existing System

- Prior studies have applied deep learning models such as:
  - **DenseNet-169**
  - **VGG-19**
  
- However, achieving very high accuracy remained challenging despite using transfer learning techniques.

## üöÄ Proposed System

To overcome the limitations of existing approaches, our system integrates:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  
  For image recognition and classification.
  
- **MobileNet**  
  A lightweight, computationally efficient CNN optimized for mobile and embedded systems.
  
- **EfficientNet-B0**  
  An architecture that optimizes depth, width, and resolution to deliver high accuracy with low computational cost.

**Goal:** To provide a more accurate, efficient, and scalable solution for real-time pneumonia detection.
